# ios Technical Interview Exercise
In this project, you are tasked with creating the main screen of an iOS app using Swift programming language and UIKit. The app is a social polling platform where users can create and share polls on various topics. Your task involves displaying mock data representing user-generated polls. This app is an opportunity to demonstrate your ability to craft a user-friendly interface, manage data efficiently, and implement the MVVM architectural pattern to produce a clean, maintainable, and well-structured codebase. 

Your work will include not only the development of the app but also the creation of comprehensive unit and UI tests to ensure reliability and robustness. Through this project, you will showcase your understanding of Apple's design guidelines and your ability to create an intuitive and accessible user experience.

### Requisites
- You should use Swift 5 to build your project.
- Your project canâ€™t contain any warnings or build errors.
- It should be a Universal app.
- Compile your project using Xcode 15.3 and iOS 17 SDK.

### What will be evaluated?
- The elegance of your code.
- Your design patterns and computer science foundation.
- Your User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) skills.
- Your attention to detail.

### What are the receivables?
- You can find the [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/kqwlwCudPr2IL3nvg0heq1/SevenApps-Technical-Interview-Exercise?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=dev&t=4UeiJAyhIdvMHUqO-1) prepared explicitly for this task.

### What are the deliverables?
- A zip file containing your .xcodeproj or .xcworkspace (if Cocoapods is used) and all assets. If you need to provide any comments or instructions, you can place a [README.md](http://README.md) file at the root of your project.


>Our goal is to get to know you better as a design-oriented developer. So, please make sure your DNA is imprinted into your code and design approach. Have fun!

## The Problem
People can sometimes be indecisive, even about the most straightforward decisions. The Pollexa app aims to solve this problem by providing a social platform that allows people to get the opinions of others.

### Functional Requirements
- The user should be able to vote for a single option in each post.

### Non Functional Requirements
- The selected poll option should be highlighted, as seen in the design.
- The total votes information should be updated once the user votes in a poll.
- The percentage distribution of a poll should become visible once the user votes for it.

### Technical Notes
- You are expected to use dummy data to populate your User Interface.
- The percentage displayed in polls should be the ratio of options chosen to the total number of participants in the survey.
- Go crazy!
